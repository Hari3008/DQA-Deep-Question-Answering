The evidence is not consistent with the claim that bidders retrench large numbers of employees following takeovers. deliberate. There is little evidence of the impact of takeovers on non-financial measures in other studies previously conducted. Hence, our analysis offers some insight into the driving forces and motivation behind corporate acquisitions. Studies that examine the impact of takeovers generally fall into two groups. The first group deals with an examination of the effects of takeovers on share prices. The second group focuses on changes in reported accounting numbers, particularly profitability ratios, following a takeover.1 To the degree that share prices reflect an unbiased estimate of firm value, changes in share prices show the value of a takeover. In contrast, using accounting numbers to estimate the value of a takeover has traditionally been criticised for a number of reasons.For example, Stanton (1987) argues that accounting rates of return are biased measures because of distortions that can arise from the application of different accounting policies."

A direct test of this proposition is not possible due to the absence of cost figures in the database.5. The definition of industry is limited to the IBIS database. Hence, total industry revenue is limited to those firms on the database and will probably understate true industry revenue.","2. While we report the mean values, we prefer to focus on the median values given the presence of substantial òutliers' in the data. For a brief discussion of òutliers' see Chapter 3.3. A direct test of this proposition is not possible due to the absence of cost figures in the database.5. The definition of industry is limited to the IBIS database. Hence, total industry revenue is limited to those firms on the database and will probably understate true industry revenue.However, as we are interested in relative changes, there is unlikely to be any systematic bias."

3,"Explain why, in order for this hypothesis to not be rejected, the profitability — concentration relationship must be positive for all firms","The hypotheses we test relate to two different models of the firm: the owner — manager model, and the principal — agent model, the key distinction lying in the degree of separation of ownership and control Mergers and Takeovers: The Case of Petroleum 153 of the firm. The former theory implies that mergers only occur if they increase the value of the merging firms. The two mechanisms we consider through which mergers can increase the value of the merged firm are increased market power and increased technical efficiency. In particular, we ask whether the data is consistent with all mergers having resulted purely in increased market power, or purely in increased efficiency of the merged firm.If mergers have a purely market power effect, then this will benefit all firms: both the merging firm and its rivals.5 If one firm can increase its price, then there is no reason why other firms selling the same product cannot do the same. Hence, in order for this hypothesis to not be rejected, the profitability — concentration relationship must be positive for all firms.","This enables us to determine the effect of mergers on both the merging firm and its rivals, allowing us to discriminate between the different hypotheses about the effects of mergers.The hypotheses we test relate to two different models of the firm: the owner — manager model, and the principal — agent model, the key distinction lying in the degree of separation of ownership and control Mergers and Takeovers: The Case of Petroleum 153 of the firm.

Hence, in order for this hypothesis to not be rejected, the profitability — concentration relationship must be positive for all firms.6 (Note that this industry-wide benefit occurs at the expense of consumers/downstream firms, and involves a reduction in economic efficiency.) In contrast, if the mergers have a purely efficiency increasing effect, then mergers will increase the profitability of the merging firm but decrease that of its rivals. The merged firm gains a cost advantage and can now price-squeeze its rivals. Thus, the overall effect of a series of such mergers on a firm which is sometimes the merging firm and at other times a rival to the merging firms is ambiguous. The only way this hypothesis can be tested is to observe the effect of the mergers on a firm that is always in the role of a rival to the merging firms. Such a firm exists in our study, and should display a negative profitability-concentration relationship if all mergers result only in increased efficiency of the merging firms. management in modern corporations can result in mergers occurring only if they make managers better off, possibly to the detriment of owners. If managers derive increased satisfaction from increased consumption of perquisites as the firm grows through merger, then it is plausible that mergers will result in a less efficient firm. Thus, the third hypothesis we test is whether the mergers have resulted only in lower profits for the merging firm (due to decreased technical efficiency). The impact on rival firms will be the opposite to that discussed for the second hypothesis: profits will increase following a merger, since the rivals now have a relative cost advantage. Thus, failure to reject this hypothesis requires that the profitability — concentration relationship for a firm that never merges is positive. As before, the implied relationship for firms involved in some mergers but not others is ambiguous. linear relationship between firm profitability and the following explanatory variables: industry concentration, industry excess How Big Business Performs 154 refinery capacity, growth of industry revenues, and the total number of retail sites in the industry.7 Interestingly, no evidence of a relationship between firm profitability and world crude oil prices existed. This was unexpected given that this is obviously the basic material input of petroleum products. A linear time trend also did not appear to explain variation in profitability. We used the ratio of earnings before depreciation, interest and tax to revenues (i.e., the EBDIT margin) to measure profitability. Concentration was measured using the Lerner index.It is expected that increased excess refinery capacity will result in lower profitability because it increases the incentives to price-cut. The incentives to operate at maximum capacity are high in an industry characterised by high fixed costs (as is the petroleum industry). Thus, when demand is relatively scarce (i.e., there is excess capacity), firms compete vigorously in order to win market share and increase capacity utilisation."
4,Explain why any costs of this nature are in addition to those reported below,"Other costs may also be attributable to monopolistic outcomes. If firms achieve and maintain their monopoly position through lobbying government for legal monopoly status, then the lobbying or `rent seeking' costs are a deadweight loss to society as well.It is essentially impossible to use the IBIS database itself to generate estimates of this cost to the economy. Hence,any costs of this nature are in addition to those reported below.","To see this, take the standard static textbook case of a pure monopolist. In the simple textbook treatment, a monopoly raises price above the marginal production cost. monopolist's product. The monopoly firm pushes up the price by reducing the amount it produces for sale. This has two effects. First, the monopoly gains increased profits at the expense of consumers who are paying a higher price for the good. This is a transfer from one group to another, which may or may not be viewed as a bad thing. Second, the reduction in output for sale leads to a loss to the economy that is NOT compensated by gains to the monopolist. As a result, not only do producers gain while consumers lose, but there is a loss to the economy which is unmatched by gains elsewhere. This net loss to the economy is what will be of interest here, and the IBIS database is well suited to generating estimates of the magnitude of this loss. of concentrated market structure: that is, situations where there is more than one producer, and hence not all the potential How Big Business Performs 128 monopoly power can be exercised. Some discussion of the implications of this for the estimates of the welfare loss calculated below, are presented later in the chapter.Other costs may also be attributable to monopolistic outcomes. If firms achieve and maintain their monopoly position through lobbying government for legal monopoly status, then the lobbying or `rent seeking' costs are a deadweight loss to society as well.It is essentially impossible to use the IBIS database itself to generate estimates of this cost to the economy. Therefore, any costs of this nature are in addition to those reported below.Of course, bigger firms may not be all bad. If there are economies of scale, then as firms grow, they can exploit increasing returns to scale and produce at lower costs than could a smaller firm. There may also bèdynamic benefits' to situations of market power that are missed in the static picture painted above. Market power may lead to greater product variety, faster rates of innovation and technological change and consequent faster growth.2 If these dynamic benefits are more than simply illusory, then in principle they should be compared against the estimates of the costs of monopoly as found here. is run inefficiently then a takeover of this firm, while increasing market power, may also lead to more efficient production. This issue is explored in other chapters that focus on takeovers and mergers. The analysis in this chapter assumes that all firms are technically efficient — that is, all firms produce their chosen output at least cost — but that economic distortions arise through their pursuit of higher profits.3 In this chapter, the IBIS Enterprise database is used to estimate the size of the static welfare loss (particularly in the form of lost consumer surplus) due to the presence of monopoly elements in Australian business. magnitude of the welfare loss or the size of the welfare loss relative to turnover (and GDP) for this country. That attempt was by Hefford and Round (1978) and used ABS establishment (industry) data for Australian manufacturing for the years 1968/69- 1973/74. They calculated that the welfare loss represented 0.15% of Manufacturing Turnover (Hefford and Round, p. 852). Their study essentially followed the method for measuring the cost of monopoly developed by Harberger (1954). That method has been subject to extensive criticism and today Harberger's method has been discarded in favour of methods which are derived explicitly from the formal analysis of the behaviour of profit maximising firms. Cowling and Mueller (1978) presented one Cost of Monopoly in Australia 129 such method that is both widely accepted and which may be applied to datasets such as the IBIS Enterprise database. due to monopoly is that it covers a large number of enterprises operating across a wide range of industries and markets in Australia.4 This means that the results of this analysis, unlike previous studies for Australia, will not be restricted to manufacturing."

6,"Explain why while event studies suggest that mergers are often desirable due to increasing economic efficiency, the balance of evidence from profit-concentration studies could be interpreted as saying the opposite","There are also numerous event studies of mergers that compare stock prices pre- and post-merger. Stillman (1983) and Eckbo (1983) find efficiency considerations, rather than market power, better explain mergers. Using accounting data, Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987) also find that mergers result in increased efficiency of the merged firm. Hence,while event studies suggest that mergers are often desirable due to increasing economic efficiency, the balance of evidence from profit-concentration studies could be interpreted as saying the opposite.","Industry-specific studies indicate that the positive relationship is strongest in consumer good industries in which goods are highly differentiated, and in industries populated by large firms (Martin 1993). While the degree of differentiation between products in the petroleum industry is low, it is also clearly dominated by large firms. Thus, it is not clear whether to expect this industry to exhibit a strong positive profitability — concentration relationship or not.There are also numerous event studies of mergers that compare stock prices pre- and post-merger.

As stated, the three hypotheses are that mergers result in: increased market power; increased efficiency of the merged firm; or decreased efficiency of the merged firm.Each of these hypotheses has different implications for the relationship between industry concentration (which increases as mergers occur) and profits, which will enable us to assess which of the three sits most comfortably with the evidence."

8,"Explain why both the owner — manager market power and managerial moral hazard theories of the effects of merger are rejected, while the hypothesis that mergers have increased the efficiency of the industry cannot be rejected","Since the hypothesis that mergers have resulted only in a decrease in the efficiency of the merged firm (due to managerial moral hazard) implies exactly the opposite of the efficiency hypothesis above, it follows that the results imply rejection of this hypothesis. Hence,both the owner — manager market power and managerial moral hazard theories of the effects of merger are rejected, while the hypothesis that mergers have increased the efficiency of the industry cannot be rejected.","The regression technique of two-stage least-squares was used to estimate the system of equations. For specific details about the data, econometric procedures, and statistical tests, the reader is referred to Hyde (1997), which also contains a discussion of the various functional forms used for the estimation equations. The results of the regression analysis are reported in Table 12.1 in the Appendix. The only variable that could be rejected as being an important explanator of variation in profitability was growth of industry revenues.9 However, the relationship between this variable and profitability was of the expected sign: positive. Also consistent with economic theory was the observed positive relationship between profitability and excess industry refinery capacity. The analysis also showed that as barriers to entry increased (i.e., the number of retail sites decreased), the profitability of firms increased, again consistent with theory. concentration.10 This is a striking result: as firms merge and the industry becomes more concentrated, profits fall across the industry. A number of studies have observed this negative relationship Mergers and Takeovers: The Case of Petroleum 155 (Clarke 1984; Hirschey 1985). Phlips (1971) suggests that this relationship may be observed in small open economies where imports are significant and profits are importantly affected by exports. However, this does not very accurately describe the Australian petroleum industry, where imports and exports are low relative to market size. What do these results tell us about the alternative hypotheses outlined above? First, the hypothesis that all mergers acted only to increase market power can be rejected. As discussed earlier, this hypothesis implies a positive relationship between concentration and profitability for all firms. In fact, the opposite was true: the relationship was negative for all firms. Second, we can also reject the hypothesis that all but one merger had purely market power effects, while the remaining merger resulted in increased efficiency of the merged firm. In this case, the firm involved in the efficiency enhancing merger would display a positive profitability — concentration relationship (though the sign of this relationship for other firms involved in mergers would be ambiguous). Since no firm showed a positive profitability — concentration relationship, this hypothesis can also be ruled out. rejected, since the results are consistent with the only clear prediction of this hypothesis: that a firm that never merges should exhibit a negative profitability — concentration relationship. Thus, there is evidence in support of the view that mergers have only increased efficiency, but not in support of the view that mergers have acted only to increase market power.Since the hypothesis that mergers have resulted only in a decrease in the efficiency of the merged firm (due to managerial moral hazard) implies exactly the opposite of the efficiency hypothesis above, it follows that the results imply rejection of this hypothesis.Thus, both the owner — manager market power and managerial moral hazard theories of the effects of merger are rejected, while the hypothesis that mergers have increased the efficiency of the industry cannot be rejected. petroleum industry. This may reflect the fact that the industry has a similar structure in Australia and the US. Our results are also consistent with the conclusion reached in many of the event studies of mergers, which indicate increased efficiency as being the predominant effect of mergers. However, there is no real consensus on this issue. For example, Ravenscraft and Scherer (1989) observe that the How Big Business Performs 156 profitability of acquired firms declines more rapidly than for similar unacquired firms.They conclude that this is due to the loss of managerial control as the size, and thus complexity, of the firm increases."
