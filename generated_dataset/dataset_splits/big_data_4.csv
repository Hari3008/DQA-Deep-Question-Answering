From Big Data to Performance: The Importance of Ambidexterity, Agility and BDA Integration in Business Processes—A Theory-Based Framework Abstract This chapter explores how an ambidextrous organizations’ agility is affected by the BDA capable BPMS, a specific kind of BDA capable IS (Big Data Analytics capable Business Process Management Systems). Specifically, the BDA capable BPMS functionalities and its positive effects on organizational dynamism and reactiveness towards challenges are studied. A theoretical assessment of the possibility of BDA capable BPMS in improving organizational agility, with a specific focus on the ambidextrous organizations, has been explained. A theoretical framework explaining some traits of the phenomenon has also been explained. The results highlight how BDA capable BPMS may increase the agility of an ambidextrous organization and by the implementation of such BPMS, ambidextrous organizations may be able to better achieve market capitalization and operational adjustment agility. agement Information Systems · Performance © The Author(s) 2020 39 R.

Marzi 3.1 The Integration of BDA in Modern Organizations: Perspectives About Information Systems, Ambidexterity, and Agility As observed in the previous chapter, the current literature is trying to observe how big data could be turned into value. Some scholars, fol- lowing a bit too naive approach, pointed out that the more a manager is informed, the better are his decisions. Yet, what matters the most is how the development of BDA could re-shape an organization and make it more profitable. Several scholars did try to explore the connection between BDA, Information Systems, Ambidexterity, and Agility. There- fore, the present chapter summarizes those contributions using as guid- ing light the theoretical exploration of BDA presented by Rialti, Marzi, Silic, and Ciappei (2018). employees work, how managers decide and act for the success of the organization. BDA capabilities related to people populating the organi- zation necessarily involve a cultural shift. This notwithstanding, what has been observed over the last five years, is that the biggest structural change occurs as a direct consequence of the need to integrate BDA capabilities within existing information-related infrastructures. This phenomenon is related to the fact that BDA capabilities related to infrastructure and sys- tems are frequently one of the primary requirements in the development of organization-wide BDA capabilities. In fact, first of all, the develop- ment of the infrastructural component of BDA capability may be out- sourced to a specialized provider. Thus, any organization may simply ask a trusted provider to start the implementation even before the full devel- opment of all the individual skills. Next, before starting to exploit the potential of big data any organization should at least be endowed by some basic infrastructure to collect and process such datasets. system, one of the key problems may be associated with the loss of flexi- bility that the organization may suffer because of the change. Indeed, any organization developing a new system may have to face opposition from 3 From Big Data to Performance: The Importance of Ambidexterity … 41 employees, disruption of its internal operation, and all the kinds of tech- nical difficulties. Yet, in the specific case of BDA capable IS, such systems may provide a valid help in the pursuit of organizational ambidexterity provided they are properly implemented. ambidexterity by providing the most relevant information about emerg- ing opportunities, will be explored using dynamic capabilities as the main theoretical lens. In particular, this chapter’s focus will be on the impact of BDA capable IS on business processes management.In order to do so, the first section presents a review of literature on the importance of agility and ambidexterity for any organization. The next sections will provide a notion of ambidextrous organization. Finally, it will be assessed, moving from existing research, why BDA capable IS could help an organization become ambidextrous with the improvement in business processes management. Hence, the focus of this section will be on a specific kind of BDA capable IS, namely BDA capable Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). in Modern Organizations Several theories have been proposed to justify the inability of an organi- zation to continually improve current businesses, to embrace and imple- ment innovations, or to adapt according to the changing environment (Aydiner, Tatoglu, Bayraktar, Zaim, & Delen, 2019; Raisch, Birkinshaw, Probst, & Tushman, 2009). Their conclusion is that the improvements or adaptations are not possible as the organizations do not have agility (O’Reilly & Tushman, 2008; Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996). However, organizations can work on improving their agility and performance by using dynamic capabilities approach or cross-functional teams, as pro- posed by Aime, Humphrey, DeRue, and Paul (2014). The idea of separating organizations, which successfully survived in the competitive envi- ronment, into explorative and exploitative units was brought back after seeing the poor status of organizations that attempted to improve their agility (Khan & Wisner, 2019). These types of organizations have been 42 R. Rialti and G. Marzi recognized as ambidextrous organizations. According to Tushman and O’Reilly (1996), these organizations have certain characteristic features: shared culture and common vision, a decentralized structure, and separate units for exploration and exploitation. Scholars have found how such organizations successfully strive in an environment that is changing constantly (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; He & Wong, 2004). Ambidexterity has been considered to be associated with both, increase in per- formance; and organization agility (Lee, Sambamurthy, Lim, & Wei, 2015; O’Reilly & Tushman, 2013). Previous literature has emphasized that ambidextrous organizations are more likely to adapt to changing situations as they have a higher level of agility (Del Giudice & Della Peruta, 2016). an organization may completely exploit the benefits of ambidexterity if it has adequate IS (Gothelf, 2014). The crucial role of such systems has been highlighted in BPM and, in turn, for improving the level of customers’ satisfaction, allowing quick responses to changes in the market and promoting intra-organizational collaboration, which are all charac- teristics of ambidextrous organizations’ agility (Gao, 2013; Wamba & Mishra, 2017). In the present digital era, for BPM, conventional information systems may be insufficient for enabling organizations to benefit from the opportunities that rise from the complex digital environment around them (Del Giudice & Straub, 2011). Hence, information systems need BDA capabilities for efficient business process management so that the ever-increasing amount of unstructured data can be explored and exploited for any potential opportunities (Lopez-Nicolas & Soto-Acosta, 2010; Sivarajah, Kamal, Irani, & Weerakkody, 2017). have an important role in an ambidextrous organization (Roberts & Grover, 2012; Tallon & Pinsonneault, 2011), but most of the literature has not taken into account how big data has revolutionized the information systems’ capabilities and characteristics (Yin & Kainak, 2015). itored by BDA capable IS and it can provide the right information to the right users involved (Gao, 2013), which may influence ambidextrous organizations’ agility. 43 Before understanding the dynamics of this phenomenon, it is neces- sary to properly consider the notion of the modern ambidextrous orga- nization and its traits. The Ambidextrous Organization in Big Data Era 3.2.1 The Ambidextrous Organization and Agility Duncan (1976) was the first to theorize the ambidextrous organization as an organizational competitive response to the shift experienced by organizations in the 1970s to a dynamic competitive environment from a static environment. cal and theoretical evidence have enriched the concept of ambidexter- ity in organizational studies (Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Raisch et al., 2009). Several studies have shown that the survival and performance of an organization are determined by its ability to strive for two different things at the same time. This has been reported in several studies of different things, such as Adler, Goldoftas, and Levine (1999) study of manufacturing efficiency and flexibility, Porter’s (1980) manuscript dealing with differentiation and low-cost strategic positioning, or a study by Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989) on worldwide integration and local responsiveness. As a result, an ambidextrous organization has been identified as an organization that is capable of exploring the environment and exploiting emerging opportunities simultaneously. In other words, if an organization is able to pursue current processes while being able to continuously adapt to the changing competitive environment, such an organization is referred to as an ambidextrous organization (Duncan, 1976; Junni, Sarala, Taras, & Tarba, 2013). Further explorations include the organizations’ ability to search, discover and innovate, take the risk, and to prepare the field for the exploitation task. According to Duncan (1976), exploitation includes the organization’s ability to implementing the explored innovation, producing, optimizing, and executing the tasks (Duncan, 1976). R. Rialti and G. Marzi The very notion of ambidexterity lies in its theoretical foundations within the realm of dynamic capabilities, with some scholars assert- ing that the ambidexterity may itself be classified among organizational dynamic capabilities (O’Reilly & Tushman, 2008). Indeed, higher exploration and exploitation capabilities are necessarily related to the organi- zational capability to amass and deploy existing resources to solve dif- ferent problems and to react to environmental changes. This perspec- tive has some flaws. Principally, ambidexterity itself is not a capability of an organization that could not invest in something specific to pursue ambidexterity aprioristically. Indeed, ambidexterity can be visualized as the result of the combination of several dynamic capabilities coexisting within the organization. For example, the capability to scan the market could matter. Similarly, an ambidextrous organization may be character- ized by greater efficiency and efficacy than a counterpart. alone. Indeed, organizational traits and elements related to organizational design may play a significant role. In particular, ambidexterity inherently incorporates the concept of agility (Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011). Zain, Rose, Abdullah, and Masrom (2005) identified that an organization targeting for agility has “to be quick in assembling its technology, employ- ees, and management with communication infrastructure in responding to changing customer demands in a market environment of continu- ous and unanticipated change” (p. 831). Several manuscripts reflect that ambidextrous organizations show agility.In this perspective, Lubatkin, Simsek, Ling, and Veiga (2006) have observed how an ambidextrous organization may be able to react quickly to changes in the market while focusing on maintaining a level of satis- faction amongst existing customers. This reflects the level of how much customers are satisfied with the offerings of the organization (Rialti, Zollo, Pellegrini, & Ciappei, 2017). The organizations’ ability to con-veniently adapt to change or the organizational and technical flexibility, has developed as a vital competitive feature of an ambidextrous organi- zation’s agility (O’Reilly & Tushman, 2008, 2013). been conceptualized as organizations roughly based on the widely known agile principles. In recent years, because of the rise of the digital age, a 3 From Big Data to Performance: The Importance of Ambidexterity … 45 new paradigm coming from software development proposes several tools and principles to improve flexibility and performance (Gothelf, 2014). ciples of agility. Briefly, agile approach suggests to (1) build projects around motivated individuals selected on their interests and supported by collaborative environment, (2) respond to change rather than follow it by planning only small stable tasks and accepting changes even later during the project, (3) welcome change in the project, even late if this improves the customer’s competitive advantage, (4) stimulate commu- nication between individuals and teams by regular face-to-face meetings and daily briefings, (5) give continuous attention to product or service technical excellence, (6) embrace customer collaboration in key busi- ness processes. Finally, the last two principles provide that, (7) organiza- tions should ensure stakeholder’s corporate responsibility (revise again), and (8) ensure socio-cultural responsibility. Because of the demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness of Agile approach, these principles have been seminally incorporated into organizational studies and several scholars have started to integrate organizational ambidexterity with agile princi- ples in order to provide a holistic approach to organizational flexibil- ity and performance, laying the foundations of the Agile organization approach (Chan, Ngai, & Moon, 2017; Zhang, 2005). However, the literature around Agile organization is still fragmentary and the most relevant contributions are mainly coming from practitioners who show to mangers several ways and benefits coming from the inclusion of Agile principles inside their organizations (Gothelf, 2014). Consequently, in the absence of a theoretical harmonization of Agile organization principles, Table 3.1 gives a summary of the most recent and valuable contributions and their connection with the ambidexterity organizational paradigm. Thus, ambidextrous organizations with characteristic features of agility require dynamic business process management systems so that they can increase dynamism, make process monitoring better and, as a result, increase performance (Kortmann, Gelhard, Zimmermann, & Piller, 2014; Lin, Yang, & Demirkan, 2007).

Rialti and G. Marzi The eight pieces of evidence summarized in Table 3.1 reflect the same observations made by Lu and Ramamurthy (2011), who focused on organizations that were striving for organizational agility. While pursuing organizational agility, there are two possible outcomes: market capitaliz- ing agility and operational adjustment agility. Market capitalizing agility defines the ability of an organization to react quickly and exploit any changes to address customers’ needs via uninterrupted monitoring and quick improvement of product/service. The latter, operational adjust- ment agility is the ability of an organization to physically and swiftly cope with changes in the market or demands within its internal business processes. Like previous studies, the eight pieces of evidence in Fig. 3.1 combine to form the two sides of agility in an organization as descriptive characteristics of market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility (Dove, 2001; Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011). ambidexterity may streamline its operations while being capable to better identify opportunities emerging in the market. Obviously, such capabil- ities require a paradigmatic cultural shift occurring within the organi- zation. In fact, most of the people need to collaborate so that they can make everything work as expected and need to be coordinated to ensure that agility and ambidexterity resist during challenging times. of the dual capacity of exploration and exploitation, an ambidextrous Agile Organization Market Operational Capitalizing Adjustment Agility Agility AP1-AP2-AP6-AP7-AP8 AP3-AP4-AP5 Fig. 3.1 Market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility and their role in shaping an agile organization ( Source Authors’ elaboration) 3 From Big Data to Performance: The Importance of Ambidexterity … 49 organization shows more possibility of gaining benefit from it (Lee et al., 2015). Consequently, two main results of the organizational pursuit of agility—market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility— may be considered important so that the organization can take complete benefit of exploring and exploiting opportunities efficiently and simulta- neously (Sambamurthy, Bharadwaj, & Grover, 2003). enabling the required workflow of information to completely promote agility in the entire organization. Consequently, it is difficult to identify differences between an ambidextrous organization with a high degree of agility and an ambidextrous organization with an efficient and flexible IS (Morris & McManus, 2002; Tallon & Pinsonneault, 2011). This is espe-cially true in the present digital era which features the growing require- ment of expertly collecting and exploiting the ever-increasing quantity of data. The next section explores the role of big data in BPMg and the importance of BDA capable IS (Gao, 2013) for the agility of ambidextrous organizations. Systems and Ambidextrous Organizations’ Agility Management information systems are crucial for any organization. The systems are necessary to collect, organize and analyze data generated from processes and operations. Proper information flows are necessary to make everyone working within the organization aware of what’s going on and accordingly take better decisions. In particular, such informa- tion flows are extremely useful to help managers deal with different sit- uations. For organizations pursuing ambidexterity through agility, these systems are even more important than for static organizations. Partic- ularly, they provide the information required to identify opportunities emerging in the market and to inform the right person within the orga- nization. Ambidextrous agile organizations are established on the use of information that ensures teamwork, allows the management for new 50 R. Rialti and G. Marzi projects, and ensures that everyone is acting correctly. Information and information systems are found to be related to dynamism. explained, big data are datasets that are large, heterogeneous, and unstructured and they cannot be reviewed or analyzed by typical meth- ods and tools (Waller & Fawcett, 2013; Yin & Kaynak, 2015). In this perspective, organizations wishing to obtain agility and ambidexterity should implement BDA capable IS (Hartmann, Zaki, Feldmann, & Neely, 2016). that were reported to be successful indicate that big data is the next rev- olutionary aspect in management (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Big data analytics tools give managers the ability “to measure and know radically more about their business and to directly translate that knowledge into decision making and performance” (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012, p. 4). Fast and effective decision making by managers may be enabled by BDA systems (Bresciani, Ferraris, & Del Giudice, 2018; Provost & Fawcett, 2013). According to Davenport (2014), with the help of big data, the internal processes can be streamlined by lowering the number of bottlenecks which will improve their efficiency. Hofacker, Malthouse, and Sultan (2016) report that consumer behavior patterns can be identified by the managers on the basis of insights from the customer- originated big data, and they can then tailor the products and their prices as per the identified preferences of the customer. As the organizations adopt the BDA capable IS, it may lead to organizations gaining better customer-centricity, optimization of operations, better management of risk, improved utilization of workforce, and even new business models (Bughin, Chui, & Manyika, 2010). importance of integrating BDA capabilities into business process man- agement systems (BPMS) to reveal the potential of big data (Gao, 2013; Wamba & Mishra, 2017). BDA capable of BPMS are a particular kind of BDA capable IS that span the complete organization, are capable of accumulating a large quantity of data from processes that are involved in the business, and can analyze those in real-time and communicate 3 From Big Data to Performance: The Importance of Ambidexterity … 51 results to all the stakeholders (Wamba, Dubey, Gunasekaran, & Akter, 2019). BDA capable BPMS has several features in common with traditional BPM systems that aim for fostering efficiency, innovation, and effectiveness, but it is different in certain fundamental aspects. Imple- menting BDA in BPMS may give “better real-time situational aware- ness to process participants and have the ability to tailor their responses appropriately” (Gao, 2013, p. 4). According to many scholars, to lever-age big data, BDA capable BPMS should be analytical , automatic , adaptive and agile (Clarke, 2016; Dezi, Santoro, Gabteni, & Pellicelli, 2018; Vera-Baquero, Colomo Palacios, Stantchev, & Molloy, 2015; Vossen, 2013). BDA capable BPMS should also give the system the ability of advanced analysis while data is being automatically processed from many different business processes (Wamba et al., 2019). In addition, this system can develop inter-organizational information exchange if it is applied in two or more organizations that are related (Vera-Baquero et al., 2015) and such BPMS will have the ability to adapt to situations that are con- tinuously changing and complex data that is evolving. fostered by the BDA capable BPMS. Specifically, such systems may give better customer satisfaction, quick responses to changes in the market and improved collaboration within the organization (Braganza, Brooks, Nepelski, Ali, & Moro, 2017; Gao, 2013). Therefore, the implementation of BPMS is associated with the organizations’ market capitalization agility. It is also possible to observe relationship of BPMS with opera- tional adjustment agility (Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011). Simultaneous analysis of data emerging from multiple internal business processes may be done by BDA capable BPMS. As a result of such analysis, the efficiency of internal business processes can be improved by the managers. Orga- nizations’ exploration and exploitation capabilities may potentially be improved by the BDA capable BPMS (Sivarajah, Kamal, Irani, & Weer- akkody, 2017). sively studied but the topic of BDA capable BPMS has not been focussed on to such an extent. Because of the inherent features of BDA capable BPMS, these systems may be responsible for increasing the pursuit of 52 R. Rialti and G. Marzi agility by ambidextrous organizations. Market capitalization and opera- tional agility may also be improved by these systems. The next section is dedicated to explaining the development of a conceptual framework showing the significance of BDA capable BPMS. A Conceptual Framework on Big Data, Business Process Management Systems, and Agility In this section, the significance of BDA capable BPMS for the agility of an ambidextrous organization and the outcomes of implementing these systems are discussed. The propositions underlying the developed model will also be explained, followed by the conceptual framework. changed by big data. The competitive edge for organizations may be gained by adopting information systems that are able to extract meaning- ful information from datasets that are unstructured. In this sense, most of the literature has stressed how, in order to exploit the potential of big data availability, it is important to develop flexible BDA capable IS. ities. Among this aforementioned IS, BDA capable BPMS emerges as a primary solution for this (Vossen, 2013) as it is capable of collecting data from different processes in business, analyzing them, and providing the right information to the appropriate users who are associated with business process management (Gao, 2013). ble BPMS is adopted. They may collect data from customers and exter- nal stakeholders allowing them to observe existing customers’ activities and interactions on an online platform and, additionally, to gather feed- back on products (Hofacker et al., 2016). Customers’ satisfaction can be increased by using BDA capable BPMS as organizations can provide tailored products and services to them. Consequently, these systems play a key role in improving the reactiveness of organizations toward changes in the market (Sivarajah et al., 2017). While considering stakeholder 3 From Big Data to Performance: The Importance of Ambidexterity … 53 management, interactions can be monitored by these systems which can result in process improvement and giving organizations the ability to do real-time data analysis (Hahn et al., 2016). Thus, thanks to BDA capable BPMS, organizations could also ensure stakeholder’s responsibility and develop new CSR practices. obstruction in internal business processes, like production processes or processes utilized for sharing information, because they have analyti- cal capabilities and by adopting internal business processes management perspective. According to Zain, BDA capable BPMS can improve orga- nizations’ dynamism resulting in improvement in the decision-making process speed and thereby, they could support the pursuit for agility by ambidextrous organizations as it is associated with the concept of quick- ness in the decision making process and subsequent actions. Therefore, these systems could also give real-time operational adjustment and an improvement in efficiency (Carillo, 2017). Based on these considera-tions, the following is proposed: P1: BDA capable BPMS could foster ambidextrous organizations’ agility."

(2016) confirms that BDA is associated with better performance of an organization as it facilitates better monitoring of internal processes by the manager. BDA managers may get familiarized with the performance of the processes, identify bottle- necks or problems, and may find solutions to the problems. Hence,man- agers may accomplish an improvement in the performance of the organi- zation by increasing the individual processes’ performance (Ramanathan, Philpott, Duan, & Cao, 2017).","These findings are also confirmed by Xie, Kwok, and Wang (2017) for big data in the hospitality sector. Indeed, it emerged that when the right information arrived at the right hotels, it may gain competitive advantages. Therefore, managers may give better responses to consumers’ requests (Pournarakis, Sotiropoulos, & Giaglis, 2017). Similarly, Arnaboldi, Azzone, and Sidorova (2017) evaluated how big data may be advantageous to firms only if the insights may be used by the right manager to deal with the equilibrium between the organization and the sur- rounding environment. ics. Lee (2017), for example, has emphasized that the major challenge of this era of big data is how the required information can be extracted from big data and how to exploit this new knowledge. Maklan, Peppard, and Klaus (2015) explored how knowledge generated from big data may improve marketing strategies. Then, Tirunillai and Tellis (2014) investigated the techniques to extract knowledge from big data. 31 2.6.5 Purple Cluster: BDA and Performance Related Outcomes Superior performance is the target of most managers and managers are usually more than eager to follow any possible path to improve the performance of their organization. In this perspective, BDA capa- ble IS and processes may represent a fundamental tool to improve the performance of organizations (Chen et al., 2013). As emphasized by Gani, Siddiqa, Shamshirband, and Hanum (2016) and Kowalczyk and Buxmann (2015), organizational capabilities may be influenced by BDA which can be used for identifying and exploiting opportunities that exist in the external environment. On the one hand, BDA capable IS may help the organization in scanning the surrounding environment for additional information, while on the other hand, managers have at their disposition the insights to extract new information extracted from BDA, and for formulating the strategies required for capturing and exploiting the new emerging opportunity. This is linked to the real-time insights that may be mined from big data and their accuracy. At present, managers have access to the perceptions and the ideas of consumers as they are freely and easily available on the internet and they may be analyzed with the help of proper tools (Christensen, Nørskov, Frederiksen, & Scholderer, 2017). The alignment between BDA capable IS and processes by using knowledge management tools can result in the diffusion of these insights within the organization. This may help in making strategic managerial decisions that are supported by accurate information. An organization may improve its performance by reducing costs or increasing revenues (Centobelli, Cerchione, & Esposito, 2018).The manuscript by Vera-Baquero et al. (2016) confirms that BDA is associated with better performance of an organization as it facilitates better monitoring of internal processes by the manager. BDA managers may get familiarized with the performance of the processes, identify bottle- necks or problems, and may find solutions to the problems. Thus, man- agers may accomplish an improvement in the performance of the organi- zation by increasing the individual processes’ performance (Ramanathan, Philpott, Duan, & Cao, 2017). R. Rialti and G. Marzi As it is possible to observe from Fig. 2.2, such a cluster is also intertwined with the majority of other ones. In fact, several papers from the purple cluster are positioned amidst the ones of the yellow, blue and red clusters. In this perspective, it is then possible to assess that liter- ature exploring the impact of BDA on organizational performances is also related to other streams like the ones exploring the role of BDA in improving supply chain efficiency and in process management. These observations suggest that the effect of BDA on performances exists where these capabilities, processes, and technologies are capable to influence organizational aspects. BDA alone then may not have any positive effect if the organization is not willing to change accordingly. What’s Next? The existing knowledge is systematized after the review of important manuscripts on big data and dynamic capabilities. Firstly, it is estab- lished that there are five clusters in all the research on dynamic capa- bilities (Akter et al., 2016; Wamba & Mishra, 2017). Then, assessment is done to find how BDA can increase dynamic capabilities related to the adaptation of operation processes and supply chain strategies to mutated environments (Gunasekaran et al., 2018). It was also observed that BDA is frequently linked to superior performances (Prescott, 2014). Indeed, as BDA capable IS and processes may adapt to changing data and situations, they can affect organizational dynamic capabilities by providing insights on future strategies that need to be implemented. Consequently, organizations may re-organize processes and re-allocate resources, which may affect performance positively (Wamba et al., 2017).From the example studied, according to Akter et al. (2016), the alignment between the capabilities of big data and manager’s expectations regarding the implementation of BDA should be monitored by the man- ager. It is also found that managers may not find the insights needed for developing new strategies if the big data capabilities and objectives of the organization are not aligned. ence performance with the help of newly available information and 2 Setting the Stage: BDA, Dynamic Capabilities … 33 become instrumental in the development of new routines to exploit it. capability, and how it could influence ambidexterity. the mechanisms concerning how BDA could influence organizational routines from a theoretical standpoint.
