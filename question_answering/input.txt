question : Explain why, each message must have at least 1 bit in addition to the data

context : FIGURE 8.4 A simple network connecting two machines. For one machine to get data from the other, it must first send a request containing the address of the data it desires from the other node. When a request arrives, the machine must send a reply with the data. Hence, each message must have at least 1 bit in addition to the data to determine whether the message is a new request or a reply to an earlier request. The network must distinguish between information needed to deliver the message, typically called the header or the trailer depending on where it is relative to the data, and the payload, which contains the data. Figure 8.5 shows the format of messages in our simple network. This example shows a single-word payload, but messages in some interconnection networks can include hundreds of words. Interconnection networks involve normally software. Even this simple example invokes software to translate requests and replies into messages with the appropriate headers. An application program must usually cooperate with the operating system to send a message to another machine, since the network will be shared with all the processes running on the two machines, and the operating system cannot allow messages for one process to be received by another. Thus, the messaging software must have some way to distinguish between processes; this distinction may be included in an expanded header. Although hardware support can reduce the amount of work, most is done by software
